# Introduction

## What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing framework designed for fast and scalable data processing. It enables organizations to analyze massive datasets efficiently by leveraging in-memory computation and parallel processing across clusters. Unlike traditional systems such as Hadoop MapReduce, which rely heavily on disk I/O, Spark stores intermediate data in memory, making it up to 100 times faster for certain workloads.

Spark provides a unified platform for diverse data processing tasks, including batch processing, real-time streaming, interactive queries, and machine learning. Its architecture supports multiple languages—such as Python, Scala, Java, and R—through high-level APIs, making it accessible to developers and data engineers alike.

With built-in libraries like Spark SQL, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for real-time analytics, Spark simplifies complex workflows into a single ecosystem. Whether deployed on a single machine or scaled across thousands of nodes in a cluster, Spark delivers speed, flexibility, and fault tolerance for modern big data applications.
